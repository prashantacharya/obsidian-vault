Till now, what I have is pretty basic. I am currently using hashnode to publish my blogs. Hashnode is primarily designed for tech blogs so I want to have something different.

I want to be able to write personal blogs and experiences through which I can share my learnings and experiences that might not necessarily relate to tech. For example, my journey to the US. 

## Technology used
Currently I am using Next.JS to publish my blogs. I want to make modifications to that. I would like to use astro with React.JS to rewrite my blog.

There will be two kinds of blogs:
1. Personal experiences
2. Technical blogs

I plan to have something very similar to what I have for technical blogs. I plan to source all my blogs from from hashnode. In fact, I already have most of the logic ready in an astro site.

For personal experiences, I want to source it via markdown files. Read the files and share them as blogs. I also have to think how I can make a series of blogs. It doesn't sound that tough though.

The most important thing is that I want to manage and build the site for cheap (almost free except domain cost).
